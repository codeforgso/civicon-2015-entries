2. Click on the **Issues** link on the right side of this repo's page, and open a new issue.
3. The title of the new issue should be the name of your project.
4. The body of the *Leave a comment* box should contain your project name, team name, list of team members, and a description of your project. **It must contain a link to your project's public respository.**
